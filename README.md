## Giphy Search page for Coding Boot Camp @ Rutgers!

-This is week 6 homework and hopefully approaching "Portfolio Quality". 

-This program will create a button for each search term you enter and return the textbox to placeholder status.

-When you click on the Navbar buttons they populate the page with stills of gifs found on giphy.com. 

-The gifs will only be G rated. 

-Monkey is a default button

-Clicking on the still image will replace it with the animated image* 

* there is an issue when using the second button going from _still_ to _animation_. It defaults to the first buttons textobject, even though console.log shows the test is the correct setting. I checked browser storage and there is no residual stored data from the first button. I will get help with this tomorrow in tutoring with Mark.

Each week this gets slightly easier... by the time I retire I might be average! :)
